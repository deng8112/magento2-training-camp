### STS-SS-5. Case

Merchant started working with a new SEO agency and they suggests to change his current Magento website structure which is the following:

* German website (it has one store and one store view assigned): https://www.domain.de
* Austrian website (it has one store and one store view assigned): https://www.domain.at
* Swiss website (it has one store and one store view assigned): https://www.domain.ch
* International website (it has one store and one store view assigned): https://www.domain.com

The agency is suggested to group website by language to keep website high in search results for german/english speaking people. So the structure should be the following:

* German-speaking websites: https://www.domain.de/de/ https://www.domain.de/at/ https://www.domain.de/ch/

* English-speaking websites: https://www.domain.com/en/

The difference that we should have only two domains and rest of information should be matched by first part of URL (/de/, /at/, /ch/, etc). What actions are required on Magento side to make this worked?
